Samba talloc api is usefull, but its implementation is immortal heavy.
1. Sizeof talloc_chunk is 88 bytes (amd64) + align is 16 bytes. So any leaf of the tree will weigh 96 bytes.
2. Unnecessary features cannot be simply switched off.
3. It depends on samba utils, which is very hard to dig out
4. WAF build system

This is lightweight implementation of cutted talloc api.
License - LGPL v3.
Minimum talloc_chunk size is 32 bytes (amd64)

Implemented :
```
talloc_new ( void * ctx );
talloc ( void * ctx, size_t length );
talloc_free ( void * ctx );
```
Work is in progress.

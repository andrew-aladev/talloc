Samba talloc api is usefull, but its implementation is infernal.
1. Sizeof talloc_chunk is 88 bytes (amd64) + align is 16 bytes. So any leaf of the tree will weigh minimum 96 bytes.
2. Unnecessary features cannot be simply switched off.
3. It depends on samba utils, which is very hard to dig out.
4. WAF build system.

This is lightweight implementation of cutted talloc api. License - LGPL v3.
TODO:
1. Sizeof talloc_chunk - minimum 32 bytes (amd64).
2. Features can be simply switched on/off.
3. CMake build system. Project is ready to be added as git submodule to existing CMake project.


Implemented & covered by tests :
```
talloc_new ( void * ctx );
talloc ( void * ctx, size_t length );
talloc_free ( void * ctx );
```
Work is in progress.
